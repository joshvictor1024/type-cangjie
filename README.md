## What is Cangjie?

[Cangjie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method) is among the most widely supported graphological Chinese input methods. They are well suited for consistent touch-typing unlike pronunciation-based methods, which often requires manual character selection as many characters share the same pronunciation. However, they also have a much steeper learning curve because users are required to learn the set of rules for decomposing each character into radicals, which are then mapped onto the keyboard.

Once you have learnt the basics of Cangjie, you may want to move on from decomposing each character you encounter and instead rely on reflex and muscle memory to get up to practical typing speeds. The `type-cangjie` app helps you build speed and accuracy through practice.
